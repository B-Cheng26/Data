# Data
This repository contains recorded data for exoskeleton force tracking in the manuscript [Design and Validation of a Brain-Controlled Hip Exoskeleton for Assisted Gait Rehabilitation Training].
# Introduction
The hip exoskeleton force tracking data in this repository was collected by an experimental team from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Anhui University of Technology for hip exoskeleton performance analysis. The data were collected by subjects wearing the hip exoskeleton designed in the study while stepping in place on a horizontal floor and a 5° slope surface, suitable for hip exoskeleton research.
# Equipment and Sensors
Equipment: Wearable Hip Exoskeleton. 
Sensors: Piezoresistive Sensor, Placed on the contact surface of the leg brace with the human leg, it is used to record the auxiliary force of the exoskeleton. Inertial sensors measure the tilt angle of the leg braces.
# Experimental Procedure
Forty healthy subjects (20 males and 20 females, all between 20 and 35 years of age) with no history of lower limb disease were invited to participate in the experiment. All subjects volunteered to participate in this experiment in an informed manner and signed a consent form to participate in the experiment. The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee. Each subject stepped in place at a constant speed on a horizontal floor and a 5° slope surface, and three sets of data were recorded for each scenario. For ease of experimental manipulation, a single leg was selected for analysis, and force tracking data were recorded and analyzed from the three phases of heel strike, ball of foot strike, and toe strike (i.e., the curves between points “A” and “B” in the figure below).
# Data Description
Three sets of data were recorded for each subject in each training scenario, each containing three phases in the gait cycle: heel strike, ball of foot strike, and toe-off, with 13 features recorded for each set of data. The recorded data were saved in an Excel cell, and the reference force values were appended to the last column of the Excel cell.
